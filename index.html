          "Nature may reach the same result in many ways. 
          Like a wave in the physical world, in the infinite ocean of the medium which pervades all, 
          so in the world of organisms, in life, an impulse started proceeds onward, at times, may be, 
          with the speed of light, at times, again, so slowly that for ages and ages it seems to stay, 
          passing through processes of a complexity inconceivable to men, but in all its forms, in all its stages, 
          its energy ever and ever integrally present. 
          <br>
          <br>
          A single ray of light from a distant star falling upon the eye of a tyrant in bygone times may have altered the course of his life, 
          may have changed the destiny of nations, may have transformed the surface of the globe, so intricate, 
          so inconceivably complex are the processes in Nature. 
          <br>  
          <br> 
          In no way can we get such an overwhelming idea of the grandeur of Nature than when we consider, 
          that in accordance with the law of the conservation of energy, throughout the Infinite, 
          the forces are in a perfect balance, and hence the energy of a single thought may determine the motion of a universe."
